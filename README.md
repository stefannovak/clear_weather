# MOVED TO NEW APP - MY SKIES

This is a little weather project, which is on hold as of 6/7/20 as I gain more skills to return to it. 

If you download this project and run it, you will get a screen which displays the current weather for your relative location. You'll have a 12 hour forecast and a 7 day forecast. 

The add new location button is still in progress, and the C/F switch is bugged.
